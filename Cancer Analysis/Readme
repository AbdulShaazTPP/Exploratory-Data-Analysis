Objective : To analyse and detect cancer based on gender and country and cancer types

Insights
1) People with cancer can only survive an average of 5 years
2) Most amount cancer in seen in people between the age of 79 - 90
3) Males have found to be having cancer than women
4) Most occured cancer is the colon cancer
5) Lifestyle and environmental factors (Smoking, Alcohol, Pollution) and Genetic Risk are the main contributors to severity.
   There's no strong correlation between severity and survival years or age.
   Cost and severity are inversely related, which could point to inequities in treatment or healthcare access.
6) Every cancer is of same severity
   Severity is generally moderate (centered around 5) across all cancer types.
   No single cancer type appears drastically more or less severe in this data.
   Outliers indicate exceptions, but they are evenly distributed across types.
   This uniformity might suggest that "Target Severity Score" is not cancer-type-specific or may be influenced by other factors like stage, age, or treatment type.
7) Treatment cost does not strongly correlate with cancer stage.
   Patients at early stages (e.g., Stage 0, I) might still face high costs, possibly due to aggressive early treatment, diagnosis procedures, or insurance variation.
   Advanced stages (e.g., Stage IV) don’t show distinctly higher costs — contrary to what might be expected.
8) Australia is the country with most of amount of cancer recorded
